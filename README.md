# Personal_Task_Manager
This repository conatains an application which is done as a requirement for the completion of the course 'Advanced Software Engineering'. This is a GUI based application system built on python. 'tkinter' library is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

## 1. Git
GitHub is used as a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides a collaborative environment. It hosts Git repositories and offers additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, code review, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, enhancing the workflow and collaboration with Sonarcloud.

## 2. UML
UML diagrams are used to visualize, document, and design the architecture and behavior of software systems.  I used two different softwares StarUml and draw.io to build those. Here I have used three uml diagrams.
  **1. Use Case diagram:** Use case diagrams show the interactions between users and a system's functionalities.
     - [Use Case Diagram link](https://github.com/Sheuly/Personal_Task_Manager/blob/main/TASK_Folder/2.%20UML/1.%20UseCaseDiagram.JPG)
  **2. Activity diagram:** Activity diagram illustrates the flow of control or activities within a system.

  **3. Class diagram:** Class diagram represents the static structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.

## 3. DDD
In this project, I chose a Domain-driven design (DDD) in order to identifying the problem domains to create a software solution according to the domain inputs. It provides a structured approach to prioritize the domains and build software that closely reflects that understanding. 

 The following steps are listed below: 
 
   **A)** Various possible fields and events are gathered through brain storming and significant domains are listed. [Link](https://github.com/Sheuly/Personal_Task_Manager/blob/main/TASK_Folder/3.%20DDD/1.%20EventStorming.JPG) 
   
   **B)** A clear strategic design of the domains is provided coming from event storming.

   **C)** Core domain Chart. [Link](https://github.com/Sheuly/Personal_Task_Manager/blob/main/TASK_Folder/3.%20DDD/3.%20CoreDomainChart.JPG) 
   
   **D)** Bounded context to create boundary where each domain is applied. [Link](https://github.com/Sheuly/Personal_Task_Manager/blob/main/TASK_Folder/3.%20DDD/4.%20Context%20Mapping.JPG)

 ## 4. Metrics
 I have used Sonarcloud to perform the analysis and calculate the metrics. I have measured the following metrices.

   1. Vulnerabilities: 0        
   2. Hotspots Reviewed: 100%
   3. Code Smells: 0
   4. Duplications: 0%
